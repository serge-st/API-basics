# HTTP Requests
<!-- * Completed and spellchecked -->

So we have an API, a system, or a collection of instructions to achieve some goal.

Where is it and how do I use it?

APIs should have an address, i.e. its location on the internet - URL.

And how do we reach it?

HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol and/or HTTPS (Secured/encrypted version of the same protocol).

HTTP allows the fetching of resources and is the foundation of data exchange on the Web.

----

## URLs
URL contains a protocol and location:

http://example.page.com/getDetails?new=true&fg=3 where:

"http://" - Is protocol

"example.page.com" - Is domain (i.e. location)

"/getDetails" - Is path

"?new=true&fg=3" - Is query string or query parameters

"new" - Is parameter key

"true" - Is parameter value
