# HTTP Methods
<!-- * Completed and spellchecked -->

The HTTP protocol has certain methods (or verbs) that help us to differentiate what action we are trying to perform.

----
## Examples:

**GET** - Retrieve data from the server

**POST** - Submit data to the server

**PUT** - Update data already on the server

**DELETE** - Delete data from the server

----
Usually, every browser request to a website is a **GET** request.

When you try to log in or submit a form it is a **POST** request.
