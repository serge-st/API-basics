# APIs in General
<!-- * Completed and spellchecked -->
## API - Application Programming Interface
Simply put - API is a messenger that takes requests, tells the system what you want to do and provides you with a response.

And "system" is this example is a collection of instructions to achieve a certain goal.

## Real Life Example:

Imagine you are in a restaurant, we have a waiter, menu and kitchen. 

The menu would be our API documentation, and the kitchen is our backend (we see the dishes on the menu but are not entirely sure about all the preparation steps).

In this example waiter is our API:
1. We select the dish from the menu
2. We tell the API (waiter) what dish we want to order
3. Waiter goes to the kitchen and passes your order to the chef (backend).
4. The chef (backend) prepares your request and passes it back to the waiter (API).
5. Waiter serves you the order (response).
